My complete setup, which is working good is:

Arduino Nano ESP32 board, which in Arduino IDE is set as Arduino Nano ESP32 from ESP32 by espressif boards v.2.0.14 package. 
Remember to decide which pin names you are going to use - I suggest to use by GPIO Numbers (legacy), because it is constant 
for all ESP32.

TFT_eSPI library by Bodmer v2.5.43

Adafruit GFX Library v.1.12.4

Of course it is crucial to properly set in TFT_eSPI library folder (in Arduino Folder) User_Setup_Select.h and in User_Setups 
folder to properly set all pins depending on your hardware. (You have to take a good look in User_Setups_Select.h - you have 
to comment User_Setup.h and uncomment one of setups which corresponds to your TFT controller - in my case it is Setup_200_GC9A01.h 
with correct pins set in that file).

Few minutes ago I’ve installed Arduino IDE in my second laptop, set all as I wrote above and everything works fine. Good luck!
